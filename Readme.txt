Based on the composition of wellstream fluid, the quality of products from each stage of separation can be predicted by flash calculations,
assuming phase equilibriums are reached in the separators. In this problem we solve the flash calculations of a natural gas and find:

	1. The Compositions of components in different states with varying pressure.
	2. The variation of Gas to Oil Ratio with pressure. 

The calculations are done assuming the components are at equilibrium and estimating the equilibrium constants with Standings Correlation. 

For the flash calculations:
The natural gas contains [C1, C2, C3, i-C4, n-C4, i-C5, n-C5,C6,C7+, N2, CO2, H2S] whose

Boiling temperature of components  Tbi = [94 303 416 471 491 542 557 610 743 109 194 331];
